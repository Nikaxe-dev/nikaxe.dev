                Let me face the reality. BTXT sucks. Using HTML would be much better.
            </p>

            <p>
                So, thats what I'm doing. From now on, I will be using html, as it is easier to change descriptions <br> on the google search results
                & also have descriptions on social media. I can still use BTXT, it's just that it is now <br>
                considered deprecated. All blog posts using it will stay up.<br><br>
                This is apart of the new update-3.2 on the website.
