<h1 style="color: lightblue;">FLING AND FIGHT</h1>
<h2>Games Description:</h2>
<b>This game is still in the works.
Despite being very early in development, many systems have been almost finished.</b>

A playground filled with objects to mess around with.
Heavily inspired by fling things and people (as you can tell).

Fight people, fling people, build something, it's got all of those.
Spend your time getting high combos for money, and spend it on items and gears.

Items, you spawn, and gears, you use.
Either attack players, or construct something. It's your choice.

Lead developer - @Nikaxe (Thats me!)
Lead Builder - @SirMax_Alot

# Gameplay:

Fling and Fight is a game about flinging and fighting.
Wow revolutionary, right!

Jokes aside, the game will follow you making money through combos. (infomation on that found later)
With that money, you can buy items to spawn, and gears to mess around with.

When no gear is equipped, you will be able to grab certain objects.
You can equip up to three gears at once, which will appear in your hotbar.

Fighting will be a huge aspect of the game, with the game even having two lists of music tracks for both building, and fighting.
Building will also be apart of the game, with gears to anchor, weld (which those will be breakable), and paint objects.

## The combo system

The combo system will work like any other.
On doing a task such as flinging an object, or killing a player, the player will start a combo of that type.
If they repeat the action multiple times, the combo counter will increase. After not doing the action for a few seconds, the combo will reset,
and the player will be rewarded in money depending on what they did, and how many times they did it.

There is a chance that all of this may not be released in the very first update,
but we promise to bring them in later updates if that is the case.

The game is a bit of a mix between fling things and people, and goat simulator 3.
You can ragdoll npc's and players (just like you can in ftap), just with two changes.

* While ragdolled, you cannot grab (your pretty much stunned)
* Upon ragdolling a npc or player, you immediately ungrab them.
* These may change in the future.
